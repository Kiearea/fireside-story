    <p>It was a dark and stormy night and the orange moon was rising just above the tree line.</p>
    <p>The murder of crows cawed at the passing hiker as he laced up his hiking boots</p>
    <p>Just as he took his first step a loud "CRRRRRAAAACCCKKK" resounded in the distance.</p>
    <p>This frightened the hiker. He quickly surveyed his surroundings and had the eerie feeling that he was being watched.</p>
